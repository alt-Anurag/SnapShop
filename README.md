## About The Project

SnapShop bridges the gap between seeing something you desire and finding it online. Traditional text-based search can be limiting when trying to describe a visual item. This project leverages a powerful combination of generative AI, vector search, and a serverless architecture to provide an intuitive, image-first shopping experience.

The user can upload an image from their device or take a photo, and the application will:
1.  Generate a textual description of the clothing item using **Google's Gemini API**.
2.  Find and display the top 5 visually similar products from a pre-populated **Supabase** database using **CLIP embeddings** and **vector similarity search**.

## Key Features

-   **Image Upload & Camera Access:** Supports drag-and-drop, file browsing, and direct camera access.
-   **AI-Powered Image Description:** Uses the Gemini Pro Vision model to analyze and describe the product in the user's image.
-   **Visual Similarity Search:** Leverages a custom-built Hugging Face Space API with a CLIP model to generate image embeddings.
-   **Vector Database Search:** Compares image embeddings against a Supabase Postgres database with the `pgvector` extension to find the closest matches.
-   **Dynamic Product Recommendations:** Displays the top 5 matching products with their image, name, price, and a direct "Click to Buy" link.
-   **Optimized for Performance:** Implements a smart background preloading strategy to overcome API cold starts and deliver a smooth user experience.
-   **Fully Responsive UI:** A clean and modern interface built with Tailwind CSS that works seamlessly on all devices.

# **Application Flow & Pipeline**

The project follows a sophisticated, multi-step pipeline to deliver recommendations.

```
🧠 Workflow Overview:
1. User Uploads Image
          |
          v

# Performance Optimization: Solving the Cold Start Problem

A key challenge with free-tier serverless functions and ML models is **"cold starts"**—the initial delay while the service wakes up. This caused the first recommendation attempt to fail 90% of the time, leading to a 30-60 second wait for the user.

**Solution: Intelligent Background Preloading**

I re-architected the frontend logic to initiate the entire recommendation pipeline **in the background** the moment the user uploads an image.

-   **Before:** Sequential calls (Gemini → Wait for user click → Hugging Face/Supabase).
-   **After:** Parallel calls (Gemini and Recommendation pipeline start simultaneously).

This means that while the user is reading the AI-generated description (3-5 seconds), the much longer recommendation process (15-25 seconds) is already happening. When the user clicks "Find Matching Products", the results are often already available and are displayed instantly, providing a seamless and responsive experience.

# Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

# Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or later)
-   npm (or yarn/pnpm)
-   Netlify CLI: `npm install netlify-cli -g`

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/alt-Anurag/SnapShop.git
    cd SnapShop
    ```

2.  **Create an environment file:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project.

3.  **Add your API keys to `.env`:**
    Copy the contents of `.env.example` into your new `.env` file and fill in your credentials. See the [Configuration](#configuration) section for details.

4.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```
    npm install
    ```

5.  **Run the development server:**
    This command will start a local server and handle the serverless functions.
    ```
    netlify dev
    ```
    Your application will be available at `http://localhost:8888`.

# Configuration

Your `.env` file must contain the following keys:

| Variable                     | Description                                                              | Example                                             |
